183. Customers Who Never Order.md

Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.
```shell
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```
Table: Orders.
```shell
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```
Using the above tables as example, return the following:
```shell
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

```mysql
select Customers.Name as Customers from Customers where Customers.Id not in (select CustomerId from Orders);
```
评论说 not in 效率低，考虑使用其他的语句提升效率。
