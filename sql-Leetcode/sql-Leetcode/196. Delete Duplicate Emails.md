196. Delete Duplicate Emails.md

Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
```shell
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
```
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```
Note:

Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.

```mysql
delete p1 from Person p1, Person p2
where p1.Email = p2.Email and p1.Id > p2.Id;
```
Person p1 和 Person p2是对表使用别名。 在使用别名后变成了两个表，我们需要对第一个表p1操作，所以是`delete p1`
