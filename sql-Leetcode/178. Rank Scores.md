178. Rank Scores.md

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
```shell
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

据说mysql中没有排名函数，先再试用orcale做
```Oracle
SELECT Score, dense_rank() over( order by Score desc ) as Rank
from Scores;
```
